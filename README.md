# Pico-8 Tetris

A clone of the [GameBoy version of Tetris](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy)) written on a fantasy console called the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

I've tried to be as faithful to the original as possible for the most part. There are some areas in which I've had to change things, either to make things work within the limits of the pico-8 or for artisic reasons. I've tried to include any differences in the [Differences](#differences) section.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Pico-8 is currently required to run the game as I've only supplied the cartridge.

If someone wants I can add compiled versions at some point.

### Installing

Clone the repo into the pico-8's cartridge store. This can be found using the pico-8's `FOLDER` command.

```
> LOAD PICO-TETRIS/GAME.P8
> RUN
```

## Differences

  * Board size 9x16 instead of 10x18. This is probably possible to fix but would intraduce other differences like the blocks having different patterns and there would probabaly have to be a border around the playfield.
